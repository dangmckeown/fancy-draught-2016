Updated Fantasy Prem League table app with scraper to get player data from fantasy.premierleague.com

App cross-references players' selections against fantasy.premierleague.com/player-list and returns the best *viable* team (one goalie, no fewer than two forwards, no fewer than three midfield or defence, no fewer than eleven total) and calculates their score for the season to date.

Thus far, I'm doing miserably.

For developers who want to use the fantasy league scraper, the file to use is curl.php
